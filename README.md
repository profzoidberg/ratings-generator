##Purpose
I created this app because of my love of great television. I would often find myself surfing IMDB.com to look up a show I had hear was worth watching in order to get the overall series rating. If the series was rated well, I would give it a shot. If the series was rated poorly, I would dismiss it. However, once I was invested in a show, I would return to IMDB.com and look at the individual episode ratings to see how my own opinion matched up with critics and other television enthusiasts. I noticed that when I would search a series, I would have to go to separarte pages according to season in order to view the episode ratings from that particular season. I decided that I would create my own app that was tailored to my own interest in series and episode ratings. In my app, you can search for a television series and recieve the overall series rating and a div containing each season/episode title and rating from that season all on the same page!
